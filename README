NAME
	ethrun - directly run EVM bytecode
SYNOPSIS
        echo <bytecode> | ethrun [<calldata>...]

DESCRIPTION
	Ethrun sets up a minimal Parity environment, deploys one
	contract, sends zero or more transactions to it and then
	prints the result to standard output as a JSON structure.

OUTPUT
        Ethrun outputs a JSON array in which the outcome of each
        transaction is represented like in the following example:

	   [{
             "success": true,
             "output": "",
             "logs": [],
	   }, {
             "success": true,
             "output": "0000000000000000...0000000000000001",
             "logs": [{
               "address": "5185630e41e8b32...c87aa735a24f3f6",
               "data": "0000000000000000...0000000032a0ead3",
               "topics": [
                 "6ee2ab87ef1bfa44...e959a6b0a190be6c",
                 "0000000000000000...0000000000000000"
               ],
             }],
	   }]

	The first element of the array always represents the
	transaction in which the contract is first deployed.
